### Hi, I'm Kashaf Ali 👋


🌱 I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a Master’s in Data Science from Duke University and over six years of industry experience. I specialize in designing and deploying large-scale data and ML pipelines, leading end-to-end data initiatives, and mentoring cross-functional teams.

💞️ I’m interested in Data-driven Storytelling, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Computer Vision.

### Data Science Project Portfolio

1. [Neural Network Attack with Adversarial Patches](https://github.com/kashafali8/Neural-Network-Attack-with-Adversarial-Patches) - Designed CIFAR-10 adversarial patches on ResNet20 to analyze their impact on diverse Deep Neural Network architectures and sensitivity to different patch sizes. Found larger patches more successful in deceiving networks, particularly in untargeted attacks on DenseNet-121 and VGG-16, and targeted attacks to be less effective, emphasizing challenges in cross-architecture application. 

2. [Fake vs Real Faces Classification: Application for Dating Apps](https://github.com/kashafali8/Fake-vs-Real-Faces-Classification) - Employed an advanced image classification model, specifically ResNet50, coupled with data augmentation techniques to discern fake facial images from a dataset containing 140K real and fake photos, achieving an accuracy exceeding 93%; developed innovative testing methodologies using synthetic data to underscore the challenges encountered in real-world dating applications.

3. [COVID's Impact on Students' Learning Outcomes](https://github.com/kashafali8/COVID-s-Impact-on-Students-Learning-Outcomes) - Investigated the impact of COVID on Student's Learning Outcomes, with a specfific focus on gender disparities in educational outcomes. This repository showcases two distinct projects: the first one used a combination of difference-in-difference (Diff-in-Diff) and fixed effects (FE) to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement while controlling for unobserved variation across schools, whereas the seconf one was a replication study that explored the same research question through a Bayesian approach.

4. [Moview Review Sentiment Analysis using AWS](https://github.com/kashafali8/AWS-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/README.md) (Hugging Face Dataset, NLP, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Developed an ETA pipeline for two IMDB and rotten tomatoes movie reviews datasets from Hugging Face, and conducted sentiment analysis using AWS S3, AWS Lambda and AWS Comprehend to classify the sentiment of the movie review. We also built a web microservice using FastAPI with Swagger Documentation to perform different queries that return useful information to the user. 

5. [Wikipedia Microservice](https://github.com/kashafali8/Wiki_Microservice) (Wiki Library, Cli-fire, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Created a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and uses python wikipedia and textblob libraries to perform data engineering task, while employing a cli tool using cli-fire. I also containerised it using Docker and built Continuous Delivery of FastAPI on AWS.

6. [Political Orientation Classifier For Tweets](https://github.com/kashafali8/Political-Orientation-Classifier-For-Tweets) (Naive Bayes & Bidirectional LSTM) - Designed political orientation classifiers using both generative (Naive-Bayes) and discriminative (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks) models with 87% accuracy for determining political inclination in tweets in the US.

7. [Machine Learning from Scratch](https://github.com/kashafali8/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch) - Constructing machine learning models from scratch using python: KNN, Logistic Regression and Neural Network
