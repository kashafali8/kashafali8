### Duke MIDS Projects

1. [Moview Review Sentiment Analysis using AWS](https://github.com/kashafali8/AWS-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/README.md) (Hugging Face Dataset, NLP, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Developed an ETA pipeline for two IMDB and rotten tomatoes movie reviews datasets from Hugging Face, and conducted sentiment analysis using AWS S3, AWS Lambda and AWS Comprehend to classify the sentiment of the movie review. We also built a web microservice using FastAPI with Swagger Documentation to perform different queries that return useful information to the user. 

2. [Wikipedia Microservice](https://github.com/kashafali8/Wiki_Microservice) (Wiki Library, Cli-fire, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Created a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and uses python wikipedia and textblob libraries to perform data engineering task, while employing a cli tool using cli-fire. I also containerised it using Docker and built Continuous Delivery of FastAPI on AWS.

3. [Political Orientation Classifier For Tweets](https://github.com/kashafali8/Political-Orientation-Classifier-For-Tweets) (Naive Bayes & Bidirectional LSTM) - Designed political orientation classifiers using both generative (Naive-Bayes) and discriminative (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks) models with 87% accuracy for determining political inclination in tweets in the US.

4. Machine Learning from Scratch: Constructing machine learning models from scratch using python: KNN, Logistic Regression and Neural Network
