### Duke MIDS Projects

1. Neural Network Attack with Adversarial Patches - Designed CIFAR-10 adversarial patches on ResNet20 to analyze their impact on diverse Deep Neural Network architectures and sensitivity to different patch sizes. Found larger patches more successful in deceiving networks, particularly in untargeted attacks on DenseNet-121 and VGG-16, and targeted attacks to be less effective, emphasizing challenges in cross-architecture application. 

2. Fake vs Real Faces Classification: Application for Dating Apps - Employed an advanced image classification model, specifically ResNet50, coupled with data augmentation techniques to discern fake facial images from a dataset containing 140K real and fake photos, achieving an accuracy exceeding 93%; developed innovative testing methodologies using synthetic data to underscore the challenges encountered in real-world dating applications.

3. [Moview Review Sentiment Analysis using AWS](https://github.com/kashafali8/AWS-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/README.md) (Hugging Face Dataset, NLP, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Developed an ETA pipeline for two IMDB and rotten tomatoes movie reviews datasets from Hugging Face, and conducted sentiment analysis using AWS S3, AWS Lambda and AWS Comprehend to classify the sentiment of the movie review. We also built a web microservice using FastAPI with Swagger Documentation to perform different queries that return useful information to the user. 

4. [Wikipedia Microservice](https://github.com/kashafali8/Wiki_Microservice) (Wiki Library, Cli-fire, AWS Cloud Engineering) - Created a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and uses python wikipedia and textblob libraries to perform data engineering task, while employing a cli tool using cli-fire. I also containerised it using Docker and built Continuous Delivery of FastAPI on AWS.

5. [Political Orientation Classifier For Tweets](https://github.com/kashafali8/Political-Orientation-Classifier-For-Tweets) (Naive Bayes & Bidirectional LSTM) - Designed political orientation classifiers using both generative (Naive-Bayes) and discriminative (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks) models with 87% accuracy for determining political inclination in tweets in the US.

6. [Machine Learning from Scratch](https://github.com/kashafali8/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch) - Constructing machine learning models from scratch using python: KNN, Logistic Regression and Neural Network
